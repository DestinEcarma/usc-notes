# Algebraic Equation

==An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that expresses the equality between two algebraic expressions==. These expressions can include numbers, variables, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. An algebraic equation typically has one or more unknowns (variables), and solving the equation involves finding the values of these unknowns that make the equation true.

If there is a number or a set of numbers that satisfy the algebraic equation then they are known as the roots or the solutions of that equation. In this article, we will learn more about algebraic equations, their types, examples, and how to solve algebraic equations (Cuemath, n.d.).

## What is Algebraic Equations?

> An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that contains two equated algebraic expressions. The general form of an algebraic equation is $P = 0$ or $P = Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials. Algebraic equations that contain only one variable are known as univariate equations and those which contain more than one variable are known as multivariate equations. An algebraic equation will always be balanced. This means that the right-hand side of the equation will be equal to the left-hand side.

## General Form of an Algebraic Equation

An algebraic equation can be written in the general form:

$$
P(x) = Q(x)
$$

Where:

- $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are algebraic expressions.
- $x$ is the variable in the equation.
