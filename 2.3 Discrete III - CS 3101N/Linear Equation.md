# Linear Equation

==A linear equation is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is always 1== (Cuemath, n.d.). It is also known as a one-degree equation. In its most basic form, a linear equation in one variable looks like: 

$$
Ax + B = 0
$$

Here:

- $x$ is the variable.
- $A$ and $B$ are constants.
- $a$ is the coefficient of $x$.
- $b$ is the constant term.

A linear equation is an [[Algebraic Equation|algebraic equation]] where each term has an exponent of 1 and when this equation is graphed, it always results in a straight line. This is the reason why it is named as a *'linear'* equation.

There are linear equations in one variable and linear equations in two variables. Let us learn how to identify linear equations and non-linear equations with the help of the following examples.

| Equations          | Linear or Non-Linear                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| $y = 8x - 9$       | Linear                                                      |
| $y = x^{2} - 7$    | Non-Linear, the power of the variable $x$ is $2$            |
| $\sqrt{y} + x = 6$ | None-Linear, the power of the variable $y$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $y + 3x - 1 = 0$   | Linear                                                      |
| $y^{2} - x = 9$    | None-Linear, the power of the variable $y$ is $2$           |

## What is Linear Equation?

> An equation that has the highest degree of 1 is known as a linear equation. This means that no variable in a linear equation has a variable whose exponent is more than 1. The graph of a linear equation always forms a straight line.

## Systems of Linear Equation

> A linear equation in $n$ variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \dots, x_{n}$ has the form:
> 
> $$
> A_{1}x_{1} + A_{2}x_{2} + A_{3}x_{3} + \dots + A_{n}x_{n} = B
> $$
> 
> The **coefficients** $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, \dots A_{n}$ are real numbers, and the **constant term** $B$ is a real number. The number $A_{1}$ is the **leading coefficient**, and $x_{1}$ is the **leading variable**.

The following equations are linear:

- $3x + 2y = 7$
- $\frac{1}{2}x + y - \pi z = \sqrt{2}$
- $(\text{sin}\ \pi)x_{1} - 4x_{2} = e^{2}$

The following equations are not linear:

- $xy + z = 2$
- $e^{x}- 2y = 4$
- $\text{sin}\ x_{1}+ 2x_{2}- 3x_{3} = 0$
