# Sets

**Sets**, in mathematics, are an organized collection of objects and can be represented in set-builder form or roster form. Usually, sets are represented in curly braces ${}$, for example, $A = {1,2,3,4}$ is a set (BYJUS, n.d.).

## What is a Set

> Sets are represented as a collection of well-defined objects or elements and it does not change from person to person. A set is represented by a capital letter. The number of elements in the finite set is known as the cardinal number of a set.
