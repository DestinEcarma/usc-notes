> "There is hardly any theory which is more elementary than **linear algebra**, in spite of the fact that generations of professors and textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous calculations with matrices."

**Why is Linear Algebra essential in Computing / Computer Science?**

To answer this question we first have to understand **what linear algebra is.**

 Linear algebra combines multivariate calculus, differential equations, and probability into a widely applicable mathematical theory and system that undergirds many technologies in our lives. At its core, linear algebra studies vectors and linear functions to solve systems of linear equations that contain multiple variables. It focuses on calculating vectors, which are points in space with magnitude and direction, and matrices, which are tables of numbers (Coursera, 2024).

**Machine Learning and Data Science**

Linear algebra is essential for many algorithms in machine learning and data science, including those that use neural networks, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear regression. Having a basic understanding of linear algebra notation, operations in linear algebra, and how matrices decompose provides a deeper understanding of how algorithms work and what they're doing (Coursera, 2024). AI is a term used when machines can perform tasks which simulate the human mind such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems (Lotfian et al., 2021). Thus, machine learning (ML) is a sub field of AI, defined as the study of developing computer algorithms, which use data to learn patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time by more data (Popenici & Kerr, 2017).

**Optimization**

Linear algebra techniques are crucial in optimization problems, which are central to machine learning, operations research, and computational finance. An example of optimization is the study of "The Impact Paravirtualized Memory Hierarchy on Linear Algebra Computational Kernels and Software". Paravirtualization, originally developed to help consolidate servers in commercial settings, this OS-based approach to virtualization has grown rapidly in popularity, this technique in which the guest and the host OSs are both strategically modified to provide optimized performance is used today in several virtualization systems (Youseff et al., 2008).

**Quantum Computing**

Quantum computing relies heavily on linear algebra, particularly in the representation of quantum states and the operations performed on them. Quantum computing promises to solve certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers with application domains ranging from cryptography to chemistry and material science (Häner et al., 2021).
