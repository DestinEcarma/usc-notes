# Classes And Objects

==A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class== (Understanding Classes and Objects, n.d.). 

## Class

In object-oriented programming, ==a class is a blueprint for creating objects== (instances), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

## Object

==An object is an instance of a class==. Objects have state and behavior. The state is defined by the attributes of the object and the behavior is defined by the methods of the object.
