# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) ==is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic== (Gillis & Lewis, 2024). The programming language that will be used is mostly `java`.

> Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while ==object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions==.
> 
> Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
> 
> - **OOP is faster and easier to execute**
> - **OOP provides a clear structure for the programs** 
> - **OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "*Don't Repeat Yourself*", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug**
> - **OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time**
> 
> **Tip:** The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
