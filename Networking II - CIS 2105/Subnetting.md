# Subnetting

==Subnetting is the process of creating a subnetwork== (also known as a subnet) within a network. [[Network]] interfaces and devices within a subnet can communicate with each other directly. Routers facilitate communication between different subnets (Solarwinds, n.d.).

|   **Subnet**    |  1  |  2  |  4  |  8  | 16  | 32  | 64  | 128 | 256 |
|:---------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| --- |
|    **Host**     | 256 | 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  |  8  |  4  |  2  | 1   |
| **Subnet Mask** | /24 | /25 | /26 | /27 | /28 | /29 | /30 | /31 | /32 |

## What is a Subnet

==A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network==. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination (Cloudflare, n.d.).
