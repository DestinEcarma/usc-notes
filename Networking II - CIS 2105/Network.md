# Network

==Network-to-network connections are what make the Internet possible==. The "network layer" is the part of the Internet communications process where these connections occur, by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks (Cloudflare, n.d.).

In the 7-layer [[OSI Model]], the network layer is layer 3. The Internet Protocol (IP) is one of the main protocols used at this layer, along with several other protocols for routing, testing, and encryption (Cloudflare, n.d).

## What is a Network?

> A network is a group of two or more connected computing devices. Usually all devices in the network are connected to a central hub — for instance, a router. A network can also include [[Subnetting|subnetworks]], or smaller subdivisions of the network. Subnetworking is how very large networks, such as those provided by ISPs, are able to manage thousands of IP addresses and connected devices.
> 
> Think of the Internet as a network of networks: computers are connected to each other within networks, and these networks connect to other networks. This enables these computers to connect with other computers both near and far.
