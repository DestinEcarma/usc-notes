# Interpersonal Relationships

An interpersonal relationship is a social connection or affiliation between two or more people. Different types of interpersonal relationships can include your connections with your partner, loved ones, close friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and many others who make up the social connections in your life (MSEd, 2023).

## 5 Axioms to Improve Your Team Communication and Collaboration

Lots of communication is carried on below the level of consciousness. The five axioms of communication, formulated by Paul Watzlawick, describe the processes of communication that take place during interaction. Watzlawick was a psychologist and communications theorist, who defined five basic axioms as the basis of his work. His axioms also help explain how misunderstandings and conflict can occur (Montes, 2023).

### Axiom 1: "One Cannot not communicate"

The quote "no man is an island" states that we live for each other. People need each other and are better together than they are in isolation.

### Axiom 2: "There Are both Content and Relationship in communication"

Communication should have expressions.

### Axiom 3: "Communication is punctuated"

Without punctuation, it is hard to tell whether someone is stating a statement or questioning.

### Axiom 4: "Communication Involves Digital and Analogic modalities"

Communication can be both digital and analogic; digital is the words that are spoken, and analogic is the tone of the voice.

### Axiom 5: "Communication Can Be Symmetrical or complementary"

In communication, the sender and the receiver should be at an equal level of communicating so that both understand and have the same position of power.
